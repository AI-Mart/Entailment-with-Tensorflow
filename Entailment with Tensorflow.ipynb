    "Textual entailment is a simple exercise in logic. A computer program that takes on the task of textual entailment attempts to categorize an order pair of sentences into one of three categories. The first category, called positive entailment, occurs when you can use the first sentence to prove that a second sentence is true. The second category, negative entailment, is the inverse of positive entailment. This occurs when the first sentence can be used to disprove the second sentence. Finally, if the two sentences have no correlation, they are considered to have a neutral entailment. This article will guide you through building a neural network to learn this task in Tensorflow.\n",

    "Before we get started, make sure you have Jupyter, Numpy and Matplotlib installed, as well as Tensorflow. To get a better sense of progress during network training, you're also welcome to install TQDM, but it's not required. We'll go ahead and do all the necessary imports right now, as well as letting Jupyter Notebook know that it should display graphs and images in the notebook itself.\n"

    "When you read that “Maurita and Jade both were at the scene of the car crash,” you can infer that “Multiple people saw the accident.” In this example sentence pair, we can prove the second sentence from the first sentence, meaning that this represents a positive entailment. Given that Maurita and Jade were both there to view the crash, multiple people must have seen it. “Car crash” and “accident” have similar meanings, but they aren’t the same word. In fact, entailment doesn’t always mean that the sentences share words, as can be seen in this sentence pair, which only shares the word “the”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider another sentence pair.  How, if at all, does the sentence “Two dogs played in the park with the old man” entail “There was only one canine in the park that day?”  If there are two dogs there must be at least two canines.  Since the second sentence contradicts that idea, this is negative entailment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to illustrate neutral entailment, we consider how, if at all, the sentence “I played baseball with the kids” entails “The kids love ice cream”?   Playing baseball and loving ice cream have absolutely nothing to do with each other.  I could play baseball with ice cream lovers, and I could play baseball with ice cream haters, both equally possible.  Thus, the first sentence says nothing about the truth or falsehood of the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for neural networks, they primarily work with numeric values.  To get around this, we need to represent our words as numbers in some way.  Ideally, these numbers mean something; we could use the character codes of the letters in the word, but that doesn’t tell us anything about the meaning of it, making Tensorflow have to do a lot of work to tell that “dog” and “canine” are close to the same concept.  Turning similar knowledge into something a neural network can understand happens by a process called word vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way common way to create word vectorizations is to have each word represent a single point in a very high-dimensional space.  Words with similar representations should be relatively close together in this space.  For example, each of the colors have representations that are usually very similar to each other.  Demonstrations of this can be found in Tensorflow’s own tutorial on word vectorization [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec). \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, we won’t need to create a new representation of words as numbers.  There already exist quite a few fantastic general-purpose vector representations of words, as well as ways to train even more specialized material if the general-purpose data isn’t enough.  The associated notebook for this tutorial was designed to work with Stanford’s GloVe word vectorization, the pre-trained data for which can be found at http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.   We’ll be using the 6-billion-token Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5 vectors, since it’s the smallest and thus the easiest to download.  We’ll do that programmatically, but keep in mind that it may take a while to run; it’s a fairly large file.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, we'll also be picking up our dataset for textual entailment, Stanford's SNLI dataset.  We'll be using the development set, which only has 10,000 sentence pairs, in the interest of speed, but if you're interested in getting better results and have time to spare for training you can try using the full dataset instead."

    "Unlike images, sentences are inherently sequential and can’t be constrained by size, and so instead of fully connected forward-feeding networks that take in one input value and simply run until it produces a single output, we need a new type of network.  We need… *recurrence*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (also known as RNNs) are a sequence-learning tool for neural networks.  This type of neural network has only one layer’s worth of hidden inputs, which is re-used for each input from the sequence along with a “memory” that’s passed ahead to the next input’s calculations.  These are calculated using matrix multiplication where the matrix indices are trained weights just like they are in a fully connected layer.  The same calculations are repeated for each input in the sequence, meaning that a single “layer” of a recurrent neural network can be unrolled into many layers.  In fact, there will be as many layers as there are inputs in the sequence.  This allows the network to process a very complex sentence.  Tensorflow includes its own implementation of a vanilla RNN, which can be added to your Tensorflow graph as follows:"

    "In theory, the network would be able to remember things from one of the first layers, much earlier in the sentence, even when at the end of the sentence.  The main problem with this form of recurrence is that, in practice, earlier data is completely drowned out by newer inputs and information that doesn’t end up being nearly as important.  Recurrent neural networks, or at least a neural network with standard hidden units, often fail to hold on to information for long periods of time.  This failure is known as the *vanishing gradient problem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to visualize this is by example.  In the simplest case, input and “memory” are roughly equally weighted.  The first input into the data will affect approximately half of the first output (the other half being the starting “memory”), then a quarter of the second output, then an eighth of the third output, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can’t use vanilla recurrent networks, at least not if we want to keep track of both sentences in this pair.  The solution is to use a different type of recurrent network layer.  Perhaps the simplest of these is the Long Short-Term Memory layer, also known as an LSTM.  In an LSTM, instead of the input always being used the same way every time in the calculation of current memory, the network makes a decision on how much the current values can affect the memory by an “input gate”, and makes another decision on what memory is forgotten by an appropriately-named “forget gate”, and finally makes a third decision on what parts of memory are sent to the next timestep by an “output gate”.

    "The combination of these three creates a choice: a single LSTM node can either keep information in long-term memory or keep it in short-term memory, but it can’t do both at the same time.  Short-term memory LSTMs usually train to have relatively open input gates that let a lot of information in, and forget many things often, while long-term memory LSTMs have input gates that only allow very small, very specific pieces of information in.  This tightness means that it doesn’t lose its information easily, allowing for longer retention time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, LSTMs are very cryptic. Different LSTM nodes in the same network may have vastly different gates which rely upon one another, such as perhaps having a short-term gate remember the word “not” in a sentence “John did not go to the store,” so that when the word “go” appears, a long-term gate could remember “not go” instead of “go”.  Of course, this is a contrived example, and in practice these relationships are very complex to the point of being indecipherable.  \n",

To solve this, we need to regulate to see if individual words end up being important to the meaning as a whole and we do that by a process called dropout.\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization pattern in neural network design that revolves around dropping randomly selected hidden and visible unit.  As the size of a neural network increases, so does the amount of parameters used to calculate the final result, each of which contributes to overfitting if trained all at once.  In order to regularize for this, a portion of the units contained within the network are selected randomly and zeroed out temporarily during training, and their outputs are scaled appropriately during actual use. \n",

The loss of certain pieces of crucial memory means that complicated relationships required for first order logic have a harder time forming with dropout, and so for our LSTM layer we’ll skip using dropout on internal gates, instead using it on everything else.  Thankfully, this is the default implementation of Tensorflow’s DropoutWrapper for recurrent layers."

The final output from the LSTMs will be passed into a set of fully connected layers, and then from that we’ll get a single real-valued score that indicates how strong each of the kinds of entailment are, which we use to select our final result and our confidence in that result."
